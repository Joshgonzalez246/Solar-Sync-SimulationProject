# Solar Sync â€” MPPT Solar Tracking

## Overview
Solar Sync is a student engineering project focused on developing an advanced **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) solar tracking system** to improve the efficiency of solar energy capture.  
Guided by our product owner, Dr. Mohammad Abuhilaleh, the project combines algorithm development, control system design, simulation, and hardware prototyping to deliver an intelligent and efficient renewable energy solution.

## Features
- Research and benchmarking of existing MPPT algorithms  
- Closed-loop control with real-time feedback  
- Boost converter modeling and validation in MATLAB/Simulink  
- Axis tracking for solar panel positioning  
- Hardware integration with a custom PCB, sensors, and actuation system  
- Functional prototype demonstrating precise solar panel movement and tracking  

## Requirements
- **MATLAB/Simulink R2025a** or later  
- **Arduino IDE** (for microcontroller integration)  
- **KiCad** (for PCB design)  
- **LTspice** (for circuit-level simulations)  

## Project Goals
- Develop and evaluate MPPT algorithms to maximize solar panel efficiency  
- Validate converter and control performance through simulation  
- Prototype a functional solar tracking system with real-time feedback  
- Ensure safe and reliable operation with a Battery Management System (BMS)
